Introduction: Indian Premier League (better known as IPL) is a short format (T-20) Mens Cricket tournament that is hosted in India. It is currently presided over by the Board of Cricket Control of India (BCCI). The Tournament comprises of 8 teams who complete with each other in a league format, which is followed by a knockout Stage. Some of the Teams who Played previously are no more in action (For e.g. Deccan Chargers, Kochi Tuskers, Gujrat Lions, Pune Warriors etc). Two teams have been banned for two seasons, but have been a part of the tournament for the rest. Lets check upon our analysis furthur. Just a note, the data available over her is from 2008-2019, and all the data findings have been as per the data.

In the notebook we have looked for answers to the best performers of IPL and viewed the conditions which have favoured the results.

# 1. Identifying the Top 20 Cities where the maximum games have been played

# 4. Top 10 highest scores in an Innings

In Picture Chris Gayle Celebrating his 175 run score in a match in IPL

**Observation** Chris Gayle and AB de Villiers have appeared twice in the Top 10 run scorer list. Both have represented RCB, when they have enlisted their Top 2 scores- which are in the Top 10 list of IPL History- making RCB achieve Top 4 spots out of 10, Followed by CHennai Super Kings with 2 spots. A very surprising observation lies in the fact that all the bowling teams against whom the top scores in a match is achieved are different- and comprises of 4 Teams who have been IPL champions (Out of 5).

# 5. Creating a list of the top 10 Bowlers with highest number of wickets

# 6. Creating a list of the Top 10 Wicket Takers in a match of IPL

In Picture Adam Zampa- The most economic bowler in an IPL Match

**Observation** The Team whose players have taken most number of 5+ wickets in a match are Mumbai Indians. No wonder, they have been awarded the trophy most number of times, due to their outstanding performances. The Team against which the maximum number of 5 wickets have been recorder is Sunrisers Hyderabad. This is somewhat due to the lack of middle order batsmen in Sunrisers team in the recent years.

# 7. Creating a list of the top 10 fielders (including Wicket Keepers)  

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68769656/157449018-be135574-48ef-448f-8d68-82f5d1904931.png)  
In Picture Mahendra Singh Dhoni- the player having most dismissals under his name in IPL

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68769656/157449078-1b29e844-884f-4cfc-93cd-ee4d2cfc9035.png)  

**Observation:** Wicketkeepers have a better dismissal record. Out of the top 10, 4 have been regular keepers while 2 have been part-time keepers. One of the primary reason is stumpings are credited only to wicketkeepers. Although it is actually unfair to map the fielders and Wicket keeprs- but since in the data there is no distinction available based on the position of the players- and many Wicket Keepers have also played matches- as normal fielders, we go ahead with the given explanation

# 8. Calculating the Strike Rate of a batsman who has scored more than or equal to a Target Run (The Target Run variable can be changed as per requirement- We have consdiered that the batsman has scored a minimum of 1000 runs)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68769656/157449173-1f58f8ee-aa64-49bb-976c-979a120dda10.png)
In Picture Andre Russel- The Player with the best strike rate overall

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68769656/157449379-544f8162-7123-40e9-8dae-67347822d97f.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68769656/157449257-46334331-05a1-4ed6-96ec-ce0fb20f58eb.png)

**Observations:** The Strike Rate is basically defined as the runs scored by the Batsman if he faces 100 Balls. A Strike Rate of 179.95, achieved by AD Russel, is a huge value in the game of Cricket and hence he is regarded as one of the best hard-hitters and finishers of the game. Also there are many outliers as evident from the scatterplot. B. Stanlake has scored 5 runs from 2 balls- which makes his strike rate as high as 250.00, but that won't be a suitable comparison to the players who have maintained their performance through all the seasons.

# 9. Calculating the Economy rate of Bowlers who have bowled more than the entered Ball Limit (The Ball Limit variable can be changed as per requirement- We have considered the bowler has atleast bowled 1000 deliveries)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68769656/157449469-07540790-05ab-4b0e-b44d-3d0a9369120e.png)
In Picture Dale Steyn- The bowler with the best economy rate in IPL

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68769656/157449524-66baea56-cb34-4ada-8836-24ed3d88b9fb.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68769656/157449568-1fae3556-a2d6-45ab-bbbb-b54d07966723.png)

**Observation** The Scatter Plot depicts there are many existing outliers. Players having very low ball counts have shown very high values of economy rate, as well as extremely low values- The counts of which are low, but there are examples in the dataset. These are the potential outliers, which we need to ignore in our analysis. Hence we have chosen the bowlers who have bowled a particular number of balls,and thus we are able to identify the best choice among the entire list.

# 10. Creating a list of the Players who have achieved highest number of 'Man of the Match Awards'

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68769656/157449659-131b4f6d-250b-44e4-97e6-8aab620b9c54.png)

**Observation** Most of the 'Match of the Man' award winners have been Batsmen and All rounders. Bowlers are not present in the Top 15 list. This is clearly indicative of the bias against the bowlers in the Tournament. Let me quote an incident in this regard. In the 2009 Season, Anil Kumble had achieved a 5 Wicket haul, with an economy rate of 1.57 in a match for Royal Challengers bangalore- which is still one of the best performnaces in the history of IPL. But he was not awarded a 'man of the Match' award for that Match. It went to Rahul Dravid for scoring a 48*.

# 11. Best all rounder performance- Considering Batting Factor, Bowling Factor and Fielding Factor.These parameters can be manipulated as per requirement. Showing the Top 10 list.

PS. We have calculated the Overall Scores based on the following metrics:

Batting Factor=0.5, i.e. For each Run scored, the overall contribution of the player will be 0.5
Bowling Factor=15,i.e. For each Wicket Taken, the overall contribution of the player will be 15
Fielding Factor=10, i.e. For each dismissal, the overall contribution of the player will be 10
The sum of all these contributions will be used to calculate the overall score and to rank the best players of the Tournament.

**Observation** The main reason of keeping the Batting Factor so low as compared to the Bowling an f Fielding parameter is- the number of runs socred in a match is far more than the number of wickets that can be taken by the Teams. Hence inorder to make this list not too much inclined only towards batsmen, we have kept the factor to a very low Value. In the Top 10 we see 3 Batsmen,6 All Rounders and 1 Bowler making up into the list of the most utility players.

# 12. Batsman innings wise performance against Opposition Team, The list of scores in individual matches and Economy rates of bowlers against the Batsman from the opposition Team.

I have chosen the best in Business (Virat Kohli) against the team I support (Kolkata Knight Riders). Well, as a KKR fan, the results are absolutely not pleasing.

Also displaying a list of the bowlers from KKR who have bowled against Kohl- sorted from Best to Worst:

**Observation** The Overall improvement of Virat Kohli as a Batsman can be seen in this chart. His performnace has clearly improved over time and age. Also from the given list of Bowlers, we can see Kohli has played exceptionally well against fast bowlers of the recent times, and had the lowest hittings for Slow pacers or Spinners- while in his early days.
Additional Tip: As per the Current Team, Kolkata Knight Riders should try to restrict Kohli with their options of Spinners and Slow Pacers. Fast Bowlers would be a risk factor with Kohli on strike!

# 13. Head to Head Match Analysis between the Teams of IPL
PS. We have only kept the teams that are currently existing in the IPL'20. The Teams which had been a part of the Tournament previously and is not existing anymore- have been excluded- since their contribution would not be significant anymore

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68769656/157450981-5c2c8776-a061-4ec4-a4c0-ecbcd0e7123e.png)

# 14. Team wise winning Performance at Venues

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68769656/157451043-927ee469-b3da-4c71-96b4-a3220ef2bf19.png)

**Observation** The blue and green highlights are expected for the particular teams at the venues- For e.g. Chennai Super Kings at M.A. Chidambaram, Kolkata Knight Riders at Eden Gardens and Mumbai Indians at Wankhede Stadium-since the Venues being located at their home stadium, they have played more number of matches in that place. And since, more the number of games being played, more will obviously be the chances of winnings at the particular venue. But ignoring those, ie, when considering a teams capability to perform in the away matches, we see Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings have shown very good performances in different venues, and that too multiple times. Undoubtedly, they have been the most succesful teams in the history of the tournament.

# 15. Venue wise Best Performers

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68769656/157451132-07bda68f-2d2a-4ac0-acfd-13a83d7faeb6.png)

**Observation** Similar to the Team performances, Players have won more number of "Man of the Match" Trophies at their Home Ground. But some Players like AB de Villiers, Chris Gayle and MS Dhoni have performed significantly well in away Grounds as well.
This metrics shows the reliability of a player when they are playing the game- irrespective of Home/Away Psychology. They can be relied upon as the key players in the team to perform.

# 16. The Toss Decisions taken by Venue Heatmap-in IPL

**Observation:** Indeed we have noticed that teams fielding first have won more number of matches in the following Stadiums- Chinnawamy and Eden Gardens. One of the most predominating factors in this regards is the spinner friendly pitches in these grounds, as well as the close proximity to the oceans, which induce rains and overcast conditions- helping the fielding teams to restrict the batting Teams.

# Summary:
## Conclusion: 

We have now come to the point where we summarize out findings. We shall be providing them in the below points:

1. The Tournament has shown a slight favourism towards the winning Teams. What I mean to say is Stadiums like Chinnaswamy, Eden Gardens, Wankhede etc have hosted huge number of games. Now obviously this factor adds an edge to the home teams for these stadiums- and indeed they have been the most succesful teams in the history of the Tournament- Chennia Super Kings, Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians etc. Although this is not the prime factor, yet has a weightage.  
2. Multiple players who could have been a good potential to the world of Cricket- have got very less appearence opportunities, or have been dropped due to a few inconsistent performances. We often come across news of players in the Indian Premier League, who have left the game of cricket and resorted to means to support their families.  
3. Since Each Team gets an opportunity to Play atleast 7 matches in their Home Ground, most teams have also won the highest number of their wins in their Home Grounds. But Teams like Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings have performed really well at away grounds too. This constitutes one of the major reasons, as to why these teams have been the most succesful in the IPL History.

Just would like to add a few points from the data standpoint:

1. The datasource was very stable and clean. Data cleaning activities were not very difficult and overall it helped a lot in the analysis.  
2. The data was very rich- Ball by Ball data has been provided across 12 seasons- which is actually a very difficult task to manage. Thanks a lot for the data!
